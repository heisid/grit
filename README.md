### Grit
*NOT FINISHED YET*

An attempt to implement a git client... in Rust, so that I can say "I use Rust btw".

- Install rust and cargo
- `cargo run -- [ARGS]` to test in dev mode
  
`ARGS` is supposedly partially compatible with git commands.

For now the only sub-command that works properly is `init`
